<p>We regret to inform you that we are unable to issue your tickets as our payment partner has declined the transaction due to a high level of risk.</p>
<p>Our payment processor has refused to guarantee this transaction on behalf of your bank or card issuer due to one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The card used not being in your name, address given does not match what the bank has on file, phone number is different or you were unable to be reached for verification, a virtual or temporary card was used which does not contain your personal information, this booking was made in a different country than you normally use your card in, an unusual purchase pattern, an IP address that does not match your country of residence, etc.</li>
<li>
Your credit card authorization has been immediately released.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to continue your transaction, you may do so with the following payment alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Payment via Bitcoin</strong><br />
Payment made via your Bitcoin wallet is done instantly and we can issue ticket(s) immediately.<br />
<br />

&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Western Union Money Transfer</strong><br />
Money transfer via Western Union is also a quick method, although it does have additional costs that make this method more expensive. If you choose this method, we will credit you a $20USD credit towards your booking.<br />

&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Payment via Bank Transfer</strong><br />
A money transfer to our bank is another secure option, although we are unable to issue tickets until funds clear to our account. This means that there is a possibility of a price change in the additional days that this takes before ticket issuance.<br />
