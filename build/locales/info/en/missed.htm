<p>Have you bought cheap airline tickets only to find that missing a connection has hit you where it hurts - in the pocket? Missing connections can be frustrating and incredibly expensive, but not when you take out&nbsp;<strong>Missed Connection Protection</strong>&nbsp;from Travelwaiver.</p>
<p>When you take out this protection and miss a connection (before you arrive at your first destination) you simply book yourself onto the next possible flight (in same cabin class)&nbsp;available and you will get compensated. Even if you need to check into a hotel if there are no flights on the same day we will compensate you for this. (maximum US$200 per night and room)</p>
<p>Features of Missed Connection Protection Protection for up to a maximum of 6 flight segments per itinerary providing they share the same booking number and minimum connection times required by the airline/s are observed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>No more stress and financial penalties from missed connections!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Limitations:&nbsp;</strong> You are reimbursed for EXTRA costs only: &nbsp;meals and/or overnight accommodation at the airport or hotel near the airport&nbsp;(inclusive round trip transfer) if your layover is &nbsp;6 hours or more.&nbsp;Maximum payouts of $1000.00 per person.</p>
