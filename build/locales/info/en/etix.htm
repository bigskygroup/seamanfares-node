        <p>E-tickets and what happens at Check-In</p>
        <p>E-tickets are issued free of charge. With most airlines, you will still need a printed boarding pass. At check-in, the airline&#39;s agent will ask you for your ID, compare your name against the airline database, and issue a boarding pass if everything is correct. You may also enter your data into a self-service check-in computer or kiosk and print your own boarding pass. It can be a little nerve wrecking to use an e-ticket for the first time, but take the leap and you&#39;ll see how easy, convenient and simple it is. And above all, you&#39;ll learn how practical e-tickets are.</p>
